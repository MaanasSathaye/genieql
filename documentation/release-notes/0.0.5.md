# Release 0.0.5
- driver specific null types supported.
- implemented dynamic scanner. Allows for more flexibility on what fields are specified
  during scanning. (`SELECT * FROM table WHERE 1 = 1` queries are now feasible)
- fixed bug where structure fields that matched type names would cause the type to be considered ambiguous. (issue #4)
